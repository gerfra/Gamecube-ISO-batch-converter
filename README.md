# Gamecube-ISO-batch-converter
Gamecube ISO batch converter, based on gcit (Gamecube ISO Tool) http://www.wiibackupmanager.co.uk/gcit.html.

This program was written for an educational use, does not include any copyrighted files, does not intend to support piracy. 
One day I had this idea...
I wrote this entirely in my free time for free. Then I liked the result and decided to share it.
It would be nice if you to help me, making a donation or subscribing to my channel at www.nextechnics.com.

PS: you need to download http://www.wiibackupmanager.co.uk/gcit.html and put gcit.exe in the same folder to work.

Cheers
